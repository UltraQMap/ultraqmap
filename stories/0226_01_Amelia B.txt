my friend and i had absolutely no clue who uq were before this show. i remember hearing jakobs voice and thinking wow he sounds a lot like billy joe. we met kev and enzo at the merch booth after, i bought a keychain purely because i wanted to say hi (ive kept in on my bag every day since). enzo was so so kind to me, really stood out as a genuinely nice guy, and my friend was so happy because kevin high fived her hearing it was her first ever concert. it was there first show in the uk on that tour so they charged me in euros on their german card reader than came up on my bank statement as “evil greed”. uq have been my most listened to artist almost every month since that show, im so grateful that i discovered them.

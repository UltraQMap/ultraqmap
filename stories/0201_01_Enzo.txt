this was with the red pears, one of the last few shows. i remember the band asking people who were coming to these shows to wear clown make-up. i helped my boyfriend paint his face in the bathroom 2 hours before we left, it was real simple, but we both giggled over it because he honestly looked really silly with his red nose. although it had been my 6th show at the time, i was still absolutely buzzing with adrenaline. once ultra q came on, i screamed so loud that i felt bad for my boyfriend, who was standing right next to me. it was great, enzo came onstage wearing a devil horn headband, which i thought was pretty funny. towards the end of their set, during i love robert smith, the crowd was already pretty intense as we were in the very front not too far from the pit and people pushing. i almost broke my arm trying to reach for my boyfriend due to all the people being pushed towards the front. after the show, we had waited around for a couple minutes to see if we could maybe meet any of the guys. i ended up getting a hug from enzo and jakob that night, definitely one of my all-time favorite shows so far.

i had my first kiss at this show. i honestly don't remember too many details but i'm pretty sure it was during so very emo, one of my favorite songs at the time. it was my very first ultra q show as well, and i don't think i'll ever forget it. i also met jakob before the doors opened and got so nervous i turned around, and attempted to run away into the street. it's such a fond memory for me, i'll never forget the bruises all over my knees the very next morning from constantly being knocked against the edge of the wooden stage.
